# The Bench Prophet
A game prediction web app using ML, Flask, and React.

Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo

Motivation:
The NBA is one of the most popular sports leagues worldwide, with millions of fans (including us) analyzing matchups and making predictions. However, most casual fans rely on intuition rather than data-driven insights. Our project aims to bridge this gap by developing a machine learning-powered NBA match predictor that leverages historical data, team performance metrics, and player statistics to generate informed predictions.
This project offers us valuable hands-on experience in data science, machine learning, and full-stack development while working on a practical and engaging application. By providing NBA enthusiasts with a powerful analytical tool, we hope to enhance their understanding of the game and improve the way they approach predictions.

Current Progress:
1. Creation of login features and database (using Firebase)
2. Setting up of a basic frontend (using HTML)
3. Web scraper algorithm developed
4. Machine Learning model developed (using Logistic Regression)

Future Plans:
1. Touching up on database and frontend
2. Implementing more features
3. User testing and Debugging
